Syntax Highlighter -- prints highlighted source code


Summary -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Parses and prints a byte buffer with highlighting of syntax for the
    selected language.

    The language is selected by calling shl_select_language() with the name
    of a file as argument.

    Example: Select the C language.
    
        shl_select_language("EXAMPLE.C")

    The parsing and printing highlighted strings are performed by calling
    shl_highlight() with appropriate arguments.

    *   Keywords for the language, ex: if, then, else, return
    *   Single-line comments, ex: // single-line comment
    *   Multi-line comments, ex: /* multi-line comment */
    *   Strings, ex: "this is a string"
    *   Numeric constants, ex: 3.14159, 0xFACE, .01

    Languages need to be defined in shl.c, there is no reading of
    language definition files (yet).

    Possible to parse and print none, parts or all of the byte buffer so that
    the CPU load can be kept to a minimum.

    Keeps state of multi-line comments to enable faster parsing in editors,
    for example Lean Editor.
