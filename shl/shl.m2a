[7m[21m[1m Summary 
[0m
Parses and prints a byte buffer with highlighting of syntax for the
selected language.

The language is selected by calling [1mshl_select_language()[22m with the
name of a file as argument.

[3mExample: Select the C language[23m
    [1mshl_select_language("EXAMPLE.C")[22m

The parsing and printing highlighted strings are performed by calling
[1mshl_highlight()[22m with appropriate arguments.

[0m[1m-[22m Keywords for the language, ex: [1mif[22m, [1mthen[22m, [1melse[22m, [1mreturn[22m
[0m[1m-[22m Single-line comments, ex: [1m// single-line comment[22m
[0m[1m-[22m Multi-line comments, ex: [1m/* multi-line comment */[22m
[0m[1m-[22m Strings, ex: [1m"this is a string"[22m
[0m[1m-[22m Numeric constants, ex: [1m3.14159[22m, [1m0xFACE[22m, [1m.01[22m

Languages need to be defined in shl.c, there is no reading of
language definition files (yet).

Possible to parse and print none, parts or all of the byte buffer so that
the CPU load can be kept to a minimum.

Keeps state of multi-line comments to enable faster parsing in editors,
for example Lean Editor.
