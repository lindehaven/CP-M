					ue -- micro editor

 ue is a basic functional terminal screen editor written in C. It uses no
 libraries except clib. Cursor control is provided by the *nix console. The
 following functions and associated control keys are provided:

	^E	cursor up
	^S	cursor left
	^D	cursor right
	^X	cursor down
	^A	word left
	^F	word right
	^[	start of line
	^]	end of line
	^R	page up
	^C	page down
	^T	top of file
	^B	bottom of file
	^G	delete cursor char
	^H	delete previous char
	^Y	delete rest of line
	^U	undo
	^W	write file to disk
	^L	look (search)
	^Q	quit
	^I	insert <TAB> char
Plus the ever popular insert ASCII chars.

All of this in a smaller binary than the original.

The original was released into the Public Domain, so is this. Do with it what
you will.

Thanks to Mike McQuade for help optimizing and debugging this package.

Installing:

ue comes as source only. Compile with:

	gcc ue.c -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o ue ; strip ue ; ls -al ue 

Copy the binary to a file on the search path, e.g.

	/usr/local/bin or /usr/bin

For the smallest usable binary, get sstrip from Muppet labs in:
http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/pub/software/ELFkickers-2.0a.tar.gz
build and use instead of strip. sstrip will remove an additional 1.5k.

ue size without strip:	18k
ue size with strip:		6.3k
ue size with sstrip:	4.6k

Operation:

ue requires a file name. If a file name is not provided, ue will refuse to
run. If it exists, the file is opened for editing, if not, the file is created
by writing the newly entered text to disk.

There is no status line. The search prompt pre-empts the first line.

Text buffer size, undo buffer size, horizontal width, vertical height and tab
size are fixed. Change the source and compile to suit your needs.

The search string input can be terminated by <Esc>, <Enter> or ^L. 

<Esc> aborts the search function, <Enter> or ^L proceeds with the search. 

'Search again' is a '^L^L' sequence away.

The search string is retained and redisplayed. Use ^H to erase prior
characters in the search string. Undo is not implemented for input to the
search string.

This editor started life as Anthony Howe's 'ant', the 1991 Obfuscated C Code
winner. Thanks, Anthony, really elegant logic. 

Since then, the curses library was replaced with STDIN/STDOUT. it was
converted from a 'vi' style editor to a screen editor, undo, string search,
backspace delete, 'delete-rest-of-line' and general code size optimization
were added. 

The original split text buffer model was converted to a standard
'insert/delete at point of cursor'. 

Limitations:

Can't change file name from within ue.

No redo, but the structure is there.

No marked blocks and associated copy, cut and paste. Use gpm from the text
console or use xterm/rxvt to copy/paste from/to ue.

Unused control codes are inserted into the text buffer but not displayed.
This is a limitation of the console not ue. Use ^U (undo) to remove them.

Changes:

1.25 Sept. 6, 2002
Initial release 'OOPS' fix.
Added 'Limitations' and 'Changes' sections, this file.
Corrected 'compile with' command line, this file.
Improved 'compile with' command line for size in ue.c and this file.
Picked up a size optimization in function look().
Fixed getch() to ignore PC function keys and to properly accept 'paste' text
 from gpm or X terminal.
Changed array 'key[]' from type short to char for reduced size.

1.24 Sept. 5, 2002
Initial release.
