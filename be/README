Binary Editor -- a small binary editor for programmers


Summary ---------------------------------------------------------------

    Binary Editor (BE) enables hexadecimal and ASCII editing of binary
    files up to 32 KB in size.
    
    CP/M programs starts at address 0x0100 by default so this is also
    the address offset used by BE as default. This can be changed by
    the user when starting BE.
    
    BE continuously keeps track of the current position and displays
    that on the top of the terminal screen together with the total file
    size.
    
    Any unsaved edits are marked with inverse video on the terminal
    screen. The user must also confirm if unsaved edits shall be saved
    or discarded when exiting BE.
    
    NOTE! If ^S is pressed repeatedly then screen output may pause.
          Press ^Q once to unpause.

    Keyboard mapping can be easily changed without compiling the BE
    source code, assembling and linking. There are 13 editor keys that
    are located at 0x0010 - 0x0028 in BE.COM. By editing BE.COM using
    itself(!) you can change these key mappings and save the BE.COM
    that you want. The help text for key mappings are located at
    0x0030 - 0x00ff and you should edit those too while you are at it.
    Save a backup of the original BE.COM before you start editing.
