Lean Editor -- a small text editor for programmers


Summary -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Lean Editor (LE) enables easy editing of small source code files.
    Source code files are limited to 2000 lines with lengths less than
    80 characters. The reasons are to simplify the design of LE and
    that source code files should be small.

    To give more help for programmers, LE can be linked with the
    Syntax Highlighter (SHL) module to highlight source code while
    editing. This feature has been tested in the YAZE-AG simulator
    running on an Intel i5 at 2.6 GHz. However, the performance will
    probably be too low in a real CP/M environment with a Zilog Z80 or
    Intel Intel 8080 CPU running at a few MHz.

    NOTE! If ^S is pressed repeatedly then screen output may pause.
          Press ^Q once to unpause.


Screen Layout -----------------------------------------------------------------

    The first row on top of the screen is called the status row.
    It displays:

        *   F: filename
        *   P: number of lines in the paste buffer
        *   E: number of edits that have been made
        *   T: tab width
        *   R: current row / last row
        *   C: current column / last column

    Example:

        F:LE.C                       P:04  E:00056  T:4  R:0094/1000  C:09/68

    If an incremental string search is active then it is shown instead
    of the file name:

        *   S   incremental search string

    Example:

        S:for (i =                   P:00  E:00119  T:4  R:0382/1000  C:21/52
