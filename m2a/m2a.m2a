M2A converts and prints markdown code to ANSI screen codes. I wrote it to get
better readability of markdown files on an ANSI terminal. I use it to convert
my markdown files and supply the ANSI-coded files for my CP/M programs.
I give the ANSI-coded files the extension [1m.M2A[22m.

[3mExample[23m
  [1mM2A.COM < M2A.MD > M2A.M2A[22m

The ANSI-code files then looks ok when dumping them on an ANSI screen.
